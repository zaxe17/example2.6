				<h2>Call of Duty: Mobile was announced in March 2019, with TiMi-J3, itself a TiMi Studio Group division, which is a subsidiary of Tencent Games, 
					leading development. Many of the game's features were revealed at this announcement, promising a familiar experience for fans of the console 
					games. The aim of the game was to take familiar aspects from the franchise's previous games and allow users to access them from their mobile 
					devices. It features two in-game currencies, as well as a battle pass. The initial release was in Australia on June 15, 2019, 
					following the soft-launches in Australia, Canada and Peru. Garena released the game in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, 
					Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan & Thailand on September 29, 2019. The game was released in Europe, North America and Latin America by Activision 
					on September 30, 2019, and by Tencent Games in South Korea on October 1, 2019. VNG Games released the game after the worldwide release 
					in partnership with Activision and TiMi Studios in Vietnam on April 20, 2020. Tencent Games published the game for Mainland China on 
					December 24, 2020.
					Call of Duty: Mobile features many playable characters, maps, and game modes from previous games in the series. Different control settings 
					were included to cater to player's preferences. A "zombies" game mode was added to the game in November 2019. This game mode followed the 
					classic Call of Duty zombies "survival" formula where the player fights off endless waves of zombies, aiming to survive as long as possible. 
					A "Raid" mode was also included where the player had to defeat a set amount of waves of zombies before encountering one of two final bosses. 
					Call of Duty: Mobile Zombies mode was removed on March 25, 2020, due to the game mode not meeting Activision's standards.</h2>
